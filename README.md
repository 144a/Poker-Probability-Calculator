# Poker-Probability-Calculator
Simple Poker Library utilized for a demo where Poker hand probabilities are calculated in real time

This a simple demonstration of using game simulation to compute probabilities, rather than using
statistics to directly calculate them. In this case, poker introduces an interesting challenge in that
the game is not as simple, but can be quite different depending on the hands and community cards present, 
as well as the rules themselves. This library and demo aim to show how these probabilities can be found in
real time.
